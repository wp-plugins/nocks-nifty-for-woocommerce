Accept Bitcoin and Gulden in your store

== Description ==

Accept Bitcoin and Gulden in your store

Adds the amazing feature to accept Bitcoin and Gulden in your WooCommerce webshop. A list of features:

* Set a price in Bitcoin or in Gulden and sell directly for BTC or NLG
* Set a price in USD or EUR and your users pay the live exchange rate in Bitcoin or Gulden
* Fill out your Bitcoin address and Gulden address and you’re good to go
* If you fill out just one of the address fields all transactions convert to pay you in that digital currency

You don’t need an account to use this plugin and users only need a Bitcoin or Gulden wallet to checkout at your webstore.

What is Nocks?
With Nocks you can pay at every Bitcoin merchant with Guldens and vice versa. You can use the website nocks.nl to issue a cross payment or install our free browser extension. The extension recognizes Bitcoin and Gulden addresses and gives you the possibility to issue a payment to this address from within your browser. This way Nocks is completely integrated into your browser.
