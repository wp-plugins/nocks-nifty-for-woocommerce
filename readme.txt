Accept Bitcoin and Guldencoin in your store

Adds the amazing feature to accept Bitcoin and Guldencoin in your WooCommerce webshop. A list of features:

* Set a price in Bitcoin or in Guldencoin and sell directly for BTC or NLG
* Set a price in USD or EUR and your users pay the live exchange rate in Bitcoin or Guldencoin
* Fill out your Bitcoin address and Guldencoin address and you’re good to go
* If you fill out just one of the address fields all transactions convert to pay you in that digital currency

You don’t need an account to use this plugin and users only need a bitcoin or Guldencoin wallet to checkout at your webstore.
